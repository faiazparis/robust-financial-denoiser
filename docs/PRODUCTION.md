# Production Notes

- Performance: vectorize/compile kernels; streaming; memory mapping
- Observability: metrics, drift checks on feature norms/variance
- Security/compliance: SBOMs, signed releases, supply-chain steps
- Reproducibility: pinned wheels, deterministic seeds
- Validation: backtesting harness, golden metrics
