# Production Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide covers deploying the Robust Financial Time Series Denoiser in production environments. We aim to be **transparent about production readiness** and **clear about requirements and limitations**.

## Production Readiness Assessment

### Current Status

**Development Ready**: ✅ The system works reliably for development and testing purposes.

**Production Ready**: ⚠️ **Limited** - suitable for controlled production environments with appropriate monitoring and fallbacks.

**Enterprise Ready**: ❌ **Not yet** - requires additional development for enterprise-grade deployment.

### What Works Well

1. **Core Functionality**: Denoising algorithms work reliably on real data
2. **Data Handling**: Processes CSV files and handles common data formats
