# Advanced Math Roadmap

## Current Status: Robust Foundation âœ…

**What We Built**: A **robust financial time series denoiser** with **identity contract** and **mathematical precision**.

**What Makes It "Advanced Math"**: Currently, it's **not** - it's "rough-path inspired" but primarily standard signal processing. However, we now have a **mathematically sound foundation** that enables reliable implementation of advanced methods.

## Roadmap to Truly Advanced Math

To make your project **truly "advanced math"**, you'd need to integrate more **rigorous rough path / stochastic analysis concepts** rather than just being "inspired by" them. The good news is that our **robust implementation** provides a solid foundation for this.

### 1. **Implement Actual Rough Path Signatures**

* Compute **high-order signatures** of the price path (iterated integrals).
* Use them to capture **path-dependent features** beyond simple increments.
* Reference: Terry Lyons' *Differential Equations Driven by Rough Paths*.

**Current Gap**: We use simple statistical moments, not true path signatures.
**Foundation**: âœ… Identity contract and length stability enable reliable signature computation.

---

### 2. **Incorporate Stochastic Calculus**

* Model noise and signal using **stochastic differential equations (SDEs)**.
* Apply **ItÃ´ or Stratonovich integration** for realistic path modeling.
* Can link denoising to **filtering theory** (Kalman/Bayesian filters in continuous time).

**Current Gap**: We use deterministic regularization, not stochastic modeling.
**Foundation**: âœ… Robust increment/reconstruction pipeline ensures SDE discretization accuracy.

---

### 3. **Theoretical Guarantees**

* Provide **bounds on variance reduction or error** using rough path norms.
* Analyze **stability and convergence** of your denoising method.
* Show why your algorithm preserves **key pathwise features** mathematically.

**Current Gap**: We have empirical results, not theoretical bounds.
**Foundation**: âœ… Identity contract provides mathematical foundation for proving algorithm properties.

---

### 4. **Advanced Regularization**

* Instead of simple total variation, use **rough path-inspired norms** (p-variation, Holder norms).
* Could implement **signature kernel regression** or **pathwise learning methods**.

**Current Gap**: We use basic total variation, not advanced pathwise norms.
**Foundation**: âœ… Length validation and baseline preservation enable complex norm calculations.

---

### 5. **Benchmark Against Theoretical Models**

* Compare denoising results to **simulated rough stochastic processes**.
* Show mathematically that your method approximates **true pathwise properties**.

**Current Gap**: We test on real data, not theoretical benchmarks.
**Foundation**: âœ… Mathematical precision enables reliable comparison with theoretical models.

## Bottom Line
