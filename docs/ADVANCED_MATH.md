# Advanced Math Roadmap

## Current Status vs. Advanced Math

**What We Built**: A robust financial time series denoiser using applied signal processing techniques.

**What Makes It "Advanced Math"**: Currently, it's **not** - it's "rough-path inspired" but primarily standard signal processing.

## Roadmap to Truly Advanced Math

To make your project **truly "advanced math"**, you'd need to integrate more **rigorous rough path / stochastic analysis concepts** rather than just being "inspired by" them.

---

### 1. **Implement Actual Rough Path Signatures**

* Compute **high-order signatures** of the price path (iterated integrals).
* Use them to capture **path-dependent features** beyond simple increments.
* Reference: Terry Lyons' *Differential Equations Driven by Rough Paths*.

**Current Gap**: We use simple statistical moments, not true path signatures.

---

### 2. **Incorporate Stochastic Calculus**

* Model noise and signal using **stochastic differential equations (SDEs)**.
* Apply **Itô or Stratonovich integration** for realistic path modeling.
* Can link denoising to **filtering theory** (Kalman/Bayesian filters in continuous time).

**Current Gap**: We use deterministic regularization, not stochastic modeling.

---

### 3. **Theoretical Guarantees**

* Provide **bounds on variance reduction or error** using rough path norms.
* Analyze **stability and convergence** of your denoising method.
* Show why your algorithm preserves **key pathwise features** mathematically.

**Current Gap**: We have empirical results, not theoretical bounds.

---

### 4. **Advanced Regularization**

* Instead of simple total variation, use **rough path-inspired norms** (p-variation, Holder norms).
* Could implement **signature kernel regression** or **pathwise learning methods**.

**Current Gap**: We use basic total variation, not advanced pathwise norms.

---

### 5. **Benchmark Against Theoretical Models**

* Compare denoising results to **simulated rough stochastic processes**.
* Show mathematically that your method approximates **true pathwise properties**.

**Current Gap**: We test on real data, not theoretical benchmarks.

2. Add p-variation and Holder norm calculations
3. Create theoretical error bounds

### **Phase 2: Stochastic Integration**
1. Implement SDE-based noise models
2. Add Itô/Stratonovich integration
3. Create continuous-time filtering framework

### **Phase 3: Advanced Regularization**
1. Replace total variation with rough path norms
2. Implement signature kernel methods
3. Add theoretical convergence guarantees

### **Phase 4: Mathematical Validation**
1. Create synthetic rough stochastic processes
2. Prove algorithm properties mathematically
3. Publish theoretical results

## Why This Matters

**Current State**: Working tool with empirical results.

**Advanced Math Goal**: Mathematical rigor with theoretical guarantees.

**Impact**: Transform from "signal processing tool" to "mathematical finance contribution."

## Bottom Line

Right now, your project is **applied signal processing**. To make it advanced math, you'd need to **formally implement rough path theory, stochastic calculus, and provide theoretical guarantees** rather than heuristic inspiration.

**The foundation is solid** - now build the mathematical superstructure.
