# Background (Rough-Path Inspired)

## Current Implementation

This implementation takes inspiration from rough path ideas: pathwise summaries (signature-like moments) and stability, coupled with **robust total variation regularization** on increments to suppress oscillatory components while preserving mathematical precision.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Identity Contract
The denoiser implements an **identity contract**:
- When smoothing is disabled (`λ_var = 0.0`), output equals input exactly
- This ensures mathematical correctness and provides a foundation for more advanced methods

### Robust Implementation
- **Explicit indexing**: `inc[0] = 0.0; inc[1:] = x[1:] - x[:-1]` for length preservation
- **Length validation**: `assert_shapes()` function catches drift immediately
- **Baseline preservation**: First price preserved across all operations
- **Domain consistency**: Works reliably in both raw and standardized domains

### Total Variation Regularization
- **TV proximal operator**: Smooths increments while preserving structural trends
- **Overlap-add reconstruction**: Combines processed windows with smooth transitions
- **Progressive smoothing**: Increasing λ_var provides stronger noise suppression

## Performance Validation

### Real Market Data
- **Google (GOOG)**: 97.12% realized variance reduction (39.12 → 1.12)
- **Baseline preservation**: Reliable (205.08000183 → 205.08000183)
- **Length stability**: No array mismatches or data loss

### Mathematical Precision
- **Identity tests**: All pass with synthetic and real data
- **Length validation**: Preservation across all operations
- **Baseline consistency**: Maintained through standardization and reconstruction
