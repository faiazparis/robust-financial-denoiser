# Background (Rough-Path Inspired)

This implementation takes inspiration from rough path ideas: pathwise summaries (signature-like moments) and stability, coupled with total variation regularization on increments to suppress oscillatory components.

For context, see:
- Lyons (1998); Lyons–Caruana–Lévy (2007); Friz–Victoir (2010) on rough paths
- Gatheral–Jaisson–Rosenbaum (2018) on rough volatility
- Barndorff-Nielsen–Shephard (microstructure/realized variance)
- Cont; Bouchaud–Farmer–Lillo for stylized facts
