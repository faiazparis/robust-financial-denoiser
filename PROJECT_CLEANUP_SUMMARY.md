### What We're Working Toward

1. **Mathematical Foundation**: Theoretical understanding and proofs
2. **Advanced Methods**: Rough path theory and stochastic calculus
3. **Production Deployment**: Enterprise-grade deployment capabilities
4. **Academic Contribution**: Research contributions to the field

## Impact of Cleanup

### Positive Changes

1. **Transparency**: Clear about what works and what doesn't
2. **Honesty**: Realistic assessment of capabilities
3. **Consistency**: All documentation now aligned
4. **Focus**: Essential functionality clearly identified
5. **Community**: More welcoming to contributors

### Removed Confusion

1. **Overconfident Claims**: No more unrealistic promises
2. **Inconsistent Documentation**: All docs now tell the same story
3. **Unclear Status**: Clear understanding of current capabilities
4. **Misleading Metrics**: Realistic performance expectations

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 1-2 weeks)

1. **Test Cleanup**: Ensure all remaining examples work
2. **Documentation Review**: Final review of all updated docs
3. **Community Feedback**: Gather input on updated documentation
4. **Performance Validation**: Verify current metrics are accurate

### Short-term (Next 1-2 months)

1. **Enhanced Testing**: More comprehensive validation
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Better tracking of guardrail effectiveness
3. **User Experience**: Improve CLI and error handling
4. **Community Building**: Attract contributors and users

### Medium-term (Next 3-6 months)

1. **Mathematical Foundation**: Begin theoretical development
2. **Cross-asset Validation**: Test on diverse datasets
3. **Performance Optimization**: Improve speed and efficiency
4. **Production Features**: Add monitoring and security

## Conclusion

The project cleanup has successfully:

1. **Removed Overconfidence**: All documentation now uses humble, realistic language
2. **Established Consistency**: All docs tell the same story about capabilities
3. **Focused Functionality**: Clear identification of what works and what doesn't
4. **Improved Transparency**: Honest about limitations and future work needed
5. **Enhanced Community**: More welcoming to contributors and users

The project now presents itself as a **working tool with clear limitations** rather than an overconfident solution. This creates a solid foundation for honest development and community building while maintaining realistic expectations about current capabilities and future potential.

**Key Message**: We have built a **robust, working financial time series denoiser** that prioritizes signal fidelity over aggressive noise removal. While not yet advanced mathematical finance, it provides a solid foundation for practical applications and future theoretical development.
